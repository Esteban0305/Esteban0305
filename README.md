Hi!, I'm Esteban Mu√±oz, a 20-year-old software engineering student from Colima, Mexico. Currently studying at Universidad de Colima, I'm passionate about back-end development, especially with TypeScript. I enjoy working with databases and managing servers. Always looking to learn and contribute to new projects.
